# slang-vs-extension
This extension provides intellisense support for the Slang shading language in Visual Studio 2022.

Implemented features:
 - Auto completion
 - Semantic highlighting
 - Quick info
 - Signature help
 - Go to definition
 - Diagnostic tagging

## Configurations
You can use a configuration file named "slangdconfig.json" in the same or parent directory of the source file to define macros or search paths for the intellisense engine. The config json follows the same syntax as the settings json of the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang-vscode-extension).

## Acknowledgements
